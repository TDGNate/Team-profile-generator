# Team Profile Generator

This is a command line application that allows the user to input data for their team which will use to create an HTML file displaying the user's team's data with neat styling. When started, prompts will appear asking the user for the manager's data first, and from there they can choose between Engineer, Intern or Done (if they they are done), and it will add that user's data as well. For each role/person they add, it will bring them back to the menu asking if they'd like to add another user or they can click done which will stop the prompts and generate the file.
